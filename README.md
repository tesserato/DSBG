DSBG is a minimalist, single-binary static site generator written in Go. It transforms a directory of Markdown and HTML files into a clean, modern, and fast blog. It's designed to be simple to use, highly configurable, and easy to deploy.

- **Fast:** Single binary, no dependencies needed at runtime.
- **Simple:** Write content in Markdown, run one command, get a website.
- **Modern:** Includes a responsive design, dark mode, code highlighting, and MathJax support.
- **Integrated Social Sharing:** Built-in, optimized sharing for X, Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, Telegram, and Hacker News.
- **Feature-Rich:** Includes tag filtering, live search (Fuse.js), RSS feed generation, and easy content templating.


This README itself is an example of a page generated by DSBG. You can see it live [here](https://tesserato.github.io/dsbg/01readme/index.html).

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

**Option A: Pre-built Binary**

Download the latest pre-built binary for your operating system from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tesserato/dsbg/releases).

**Option B: Go Install**

If you have Go installed, you can build and install DSBG with a single command:
```bash
go install github.com/tesserato/dsbg@latest
```

### 2. Create Content

Create a directory for your content (e.g., `my-blog-content/`) and add a Markdown file.

`my-blog-content/2025-11-07-hello-world.md`:
```markdown
---
title: Hello, World!
description: This is my very first post using DSBG.
tags: [Welcome, Go, Tech]
coverImagePath: cover.jpg
---

This is the content of my first post. It's that simple!

You can include an image like this (place `cover.jpg` in the same folder):

![A beautiful cover image](cover.jpg)
```

### 3. Generate Your Site

Run the `dsbg` command, pointing it to your content directory.

```bash
dsbg -input-path my-blog-content/ -output-path public/ -title "My Awesome Blog"
```

This will generate a complete static website in the `public/` directory.

### 4. Preview Your Site (Watch Mode)

For live development, use the `-watch` flag. This starts a local web server and automatically rebuilds your site whenever you save a change.

```bash
dsbg -input-path my-blog-content/ -watch
```
Now, open your browser to `http://localhost:666` to see your blog.

## Features & Customization

### Content Creation

DSBG content files are Markdown (`.md`) or HTML (`.html`) files with a **frontmatter** block at the top, which defines the metadata for the post.

#### Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
title: The title of your post (required)
description: A short summary of the post (required for previews)
created: 2025-11-07 # Optional: uses file date if missing
updated: 2025-11-08 # Optional: uses file date if missing
coverImagePath: path/to/image.jpg # Optional: relative to the markdown file
tags: [tag1, tag2, "Multi-word Tag"] # Optional: for filtering and sharing
url: https://external-link.com # Optional: for Hacker News to link to an external site
---
```

#### Special `PAGE` Tag

If you add the tag `PAGE`, DSBG will treat the article as a static page (like an "About Me" page). It will appear in the main navigation bar at the top of the index instead of in the article list.

### Command-Line Flags

Use flags to configure your site's appearance and functionality. Run `dsbg -h` for a full list.

| Flag            | Description                                                        | Default           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `-title`        | The main title of your blog.                                       | "Blog"            |
| `-description`  | A description for the homepage (supports Markdown).                | "This is my blog" |
| `-input-path`   | Directory containing your content files.                           | "content"         |
| `-output-path`  | Directory where the static site will be generated.                 | "public"          |
| `-base-url`     | The final URL of your site (e.g., `https://username.github.io`).   | ""                |
| `-watch`        | Enable live preview server and automatic rebuilds on file changes. | `false`           |
| `-theme`        | Set a color theme (`default`, `dark`, `clean`, `colorful`).        | "default"         |
| `-sort`         | Article sort order (e.g., `date-created`, `reverse-title`).        | "date-created"    |
| `-css-path`     | Path to a custom CSS file to override the theme.                   | ""                |
| `-favicon-path` | Path to a custom `favicon.ico` file.                               | ""                |

### Social Sharing & Handles

DSBG automatically adds profile links and optimized share buttons. Set your handles using these flags:

| Flag                 | Example Handle    |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| `-x-handle`          | `tesserato`       |
| `-bluesky-handle`    | `tesserato`       |
| `-threads-handle`    | `tesserato`       |
| `-mastodon-handle`   | `tesserato`       |
| `-reddit-handle`     | `tarjano`         |
| `-facebook-handle`   | `your.profile`    |
| `-linkedin-handle`   | `your-profile-id` |
| `-telegram-handle`   | `tesserato`       |
| `-hackernews-handle` | `dsbg_user`       |

#### Markdown Copy Button

Every article includes a "Copy Markdown" button, which copies a clean, formatted summary of the post to the clipboard, perfect for sharing on platforms like Discord or GitHub.

### Content Templating

Quickly scaffold a new post using the `template` command.

```bash
# Creates a new .md file in the current directory with pre-filled frontmatter
dsbg -template -title "My New Post" -tags "Go, Example"
```
Run `dsbg -template -h` for all available template flags.

## Deployment

The generated output directory (e.g., `public/`) contains a complete, self-contained static website. You can deploy it to any static hosting service, such as:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

Simply upload the contents of the output directory to your host.
